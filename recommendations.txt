Id like recommendations from 

Veronica Blake as we've worked together a lot and helped eachother through grasping many concepts.

I think Justin Carpenter would be a good one, since I often go to him for help and always 
appreciate how he walks through the problems I have, he's been great to work with. I know I may have to wait till after the course to 
get recommendations from staff.

Finally I think Sam Limpic is really amazing at coding and is always more than happy to help, and he seemed 
very appreciative when I was able to chip in and add my own knowledge.
