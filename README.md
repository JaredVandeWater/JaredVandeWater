Howdy!

I'm Jared, a soon to be full stack developer!

I'm currently attending BoiseCodeWorks to further my education in building applications and websites. Before this, I held a career in QA where I found and sent bugs to developers. Over time I learned that instead of just finding bugs, I wanted to squash them!
